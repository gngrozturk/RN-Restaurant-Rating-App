# RN-Restaurant-Rating-App

RN-Restaurant-Rating-App is a mobile application that you can search restaurant by your location. In addition you can categorize restaurants by their prices and Yelp rates. **It developed by using React Native (Expo CLI)**. 

## Getting Started

In your terminal change into project folder that you created then run:
```bash
npm install
```
to install required dependencies.

After installing run :
```bash
npm start
```
This opens the React Native bundler, which gets your code ready to be run on a mobile device.

Install the **expo** app on your mobile device from the App Store or Google Play Store. Scan the QR code from the React Native Bundler on your phone.
